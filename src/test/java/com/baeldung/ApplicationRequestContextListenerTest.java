Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided `requestContextListener` method:

Scenario 1: Verify RequestContextListener Instance Creation

Details:
  TestName: requestContextListenerInstanceCreation
  Description: This test verifies that the `requestContextListener` method creates and returns a new instance of `RequestContextListener`.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the `requestContextListener` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is not null and is an instance of `RequestContextListener` using `assertNotNull` and `assertTrue` with `instanceof`.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method correctly creates and returns a new instance of `RequestContextListener`. This is important to validate that the application context is properly set up to handle request-scoped data.

Scenario 2: Verify RequestContextListener Singleton Behavior

Details:
  TestName: requestContextListenerSingletonBehavior
  Description: This test verifies that multiple invocations of the `requestContextListener` method return the same instance of `RequestContextListener`.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the `requestContextListener` method twice and store the returned instances in separate variables.
  Assert: Assert that the two instances are equal using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the `requestContextListener` method returns the same instance of `RequestContextListener` across multiple invocations. This is significant to ensure that the application maintains a consistent request context throughout the lifecycle of a request.

Scenario 3: Verify RequestContextListener Thread Safety

Details:
  TestName: requestContextListenerThreadSafety
  Description: This test verifies that the `requestContextListener` method is thread-safe and can handle concurrent invocations from multiple threads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads that will concurrently invoke the `requestContextListener` method.
  Act: Start all the threads and wait for them to complete.
  Assert: Assert that no exceptions or race conditions occur during the concurrent invocations.
Validation:
  The absence of exceptions and race conditions during concurrent invocations ensures that the `requestContextListener` method is thread-safe. This is crucial in a multi-threaded environment to maintain the integrity of the request context data across different threads.

Scenario 4: Verify RequestContextListener Initialization

Details:
  TestName: requestContextListenerInitialization
  Description: This test verifies that the `RequestContextListener` instance returned by the `requestContextListener` method is properly initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the `requestContextListener` method and store the returned instance in a variable.
  Assert: Assert that the instance is not null and its internal state is correctly initialized (if applicable).
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the `RequestContextListener` instance is properly initialized when created by the `requestContextListener` method. This is important to guarantee that the request context is set up correctly and ready to handle incoming requests.

These test scenarios cover different aspects of the `requestContextListener` method, including instance creation, singleton behavior, thread safety, and proper initialization. They aim to validate the correct functionality and behavior of the method in the context of the application's request context handling.
